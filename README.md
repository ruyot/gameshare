## Description

GameShare is the **Airbnb for Gaming PCs** - a peer-to-peer marketplace that connects gamers who want to play high-end games with PC owners who have powerful hardware sitting idle. Think of it as the bridge between expensive gaming hardware and accessible gaming experiences.

### The Problem We Solve

**Gaming is expensive.** A high-end gaming PC costs $1,500-3,000, making premium gaming inaccessible to millions. Meanwhile, powerful PCs sit idle 80% of the time, representing billions in wasted hardware value.

**Our Solution:** A marketplace where PC owners can monetize their idle hardware by renting it to gamers who need high-performance gaming without the upfront investment.
